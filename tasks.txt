# Task-1
* Create a VPC
* Create 2 subnets in us-central1 and asia-southeast-1
* Create a virtual machine with startup-script and make sure this vm is having a static ip.


# Task-2
* Create a VPC
* Create 2 subnets in us-central1 and asia-southeast-1
* Create a virtual machine with startup-script and make sure this vm is not having a public ip.

# Task-3
* Create a VPC
* Create 2 subnets in us-central1 and asia-southeast-1
* Create a virtual machine with startup-script and make sure this vm is not having a public ip.
* Try to login to the vm (Make sure you dont have the firewall to open port 22 across the globe)
    * 22 open src range : 0.0.0.0/0 =====> this shoul not be the case 



# Task-4
* Create a VPC1 and VPC2
* Create a subnet with your custom range in both vpcs
* Create 2 vms in each vpc 
* Create a firewall rule to allow ssh, http, icmp in both vpcs.
* Next login to vm in vpc1 and ping vm in vpc2 .
* Implement Peering through terraform 


# Task-5
* Create a VPC
* Create 2 subnets in us-central1 and asia-southeast-1
* Create a virtual machine with startup-script and make sure this vm is having a static ip.
    * wherther a vm should have static ip or not is the customer choise
    * create a condition where i can pass through terraform.tfvars my values, and if i want static ip create it, if not go with epemeral


# Big-Project 
## Part-1
* vpc, firewall, subnet 
* Create an instance template in centra1 with cusotm startup script
* Create an instance template in us-east4 with cusotm startup script
* Create a Instance Group in both the regions with autoscaling configured , health checks, and port mapping 
* Create a static ip for the load balacner 
* create a backend service and add both the instance groups in that 
* Create a frontend with http load balancer
* Create a route(/) to go to the backends 

## Part-2
* Create a dns public zone with your custom domain name (i27academy.in)
* Delegate the nameserver records to godaddy.(If domain is created in gcp domains, ignore this step)
* Map the a record to the static ip created above(as this points to load balancer)
* Implement Self sgined certificate and modufy the load balacner frontend to have https 
* After that replace the self signed certificate with google managed certificate .

* End goal
* https://www.i27academy.in > DNS > LoadBalancer > Routes > Backend service > BackendsCreated
